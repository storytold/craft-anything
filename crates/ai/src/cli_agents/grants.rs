//! What each adapter's builder gets, as typed data: our tool server, approvals from us, a session
//! it can continue, a note during a turn, and a message of any length.
//!
//! Two of those the adapter already answers for itself — [`AgentAdapter::resumes`], and
//! [`AgentAdapter::prompt_on_stdin`] (or ACP, which carries the message in a session rather than in
//! argv). The other three are spread over an adapter's arguments, its environment or its ACP
//! session, so they are declared here, one row per adapter, and tests check every declaration
//! against what the adapter hands a builder. An adapter without a row fails them, which is the
//! point: what a builder gets is stated in one place, and a new agent can't quietly get less.
